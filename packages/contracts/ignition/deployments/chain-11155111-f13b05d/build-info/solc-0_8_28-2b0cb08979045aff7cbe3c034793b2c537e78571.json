Note that any function without this setup won't be\n * effectively restricted.\n *\n * The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \"roles\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped\n * by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n *\n * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n *\n * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n *\n * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n *\n * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n *\n * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n *\n * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n *\n * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of\n * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.\n *\n * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an\n * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.\n * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules\n * registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions\n * will be {AccessManager} itself.\n *\n * WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very\n * mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {Ownable-renounceOwnership} or\n * {AccessControl-renounceRole}.\n */\ncontract AccessManager is Context, Multicall, IAccessManager {\n    using Time for *;\n\n    // Structure that stores the details for a target contract.\n    struct TargetConfig {\n        mapping(bytes4 selector => uint64 roleId) allowedRoles;\n        Time.Delay adminDelay;\n        bool closed;\n    }\n\n    // Structure that stores the details for a role/account pair.
